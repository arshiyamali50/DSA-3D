*Merge Sort*

Pros:

1. Efficient for large datasets (O(n log n) time complexity)
2. Stable sort (preserves original order of equal elements)
3. Suitable for parallel processing

Cons:

1. Requires extra memory (O(n) space complexity)
2. Complex implementation

*Insertion Sort*

Pros:

1. Simple implementation
2. Low overhead (O(1) space complexity)
3. Efficient for small datasets (O(n) time complexity)

Cons:

1. Inefficient for large datasets (O(n^2) time complexity)
2. Not suitable for parallel processing
